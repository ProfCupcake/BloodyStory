Mostly backend-ey mod hooks this update, intended for a certain other player death related mod ;]
- Added an event on bleedout; other mods can subscribe to this even to prevent the player from dying
- Added options for toggling the spawning of blood particles and the processing of bleeding
- Added commands to toggle all 3 of the above, intended for testing but I guess server admins might have use for them?

TODO THIS UPDATE: 
- handbook entry
/ proper Unconscious compat and/or general hooks for other mods
