 - removed now-superfluous "unconscious" check :]
 - implemented localisation
 - maybe networked particles? need someone to actually test with other players
 - two new config options to adjust amount of bleed added and to allow some amount of direct damage through
 - removed "bsconfigreload" command, since it seems not to work correctly anyway; you'll just have to reload the config the old fashioned way
 - fix for hunger issues

TODO: 
- handbook entry
